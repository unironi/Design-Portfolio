# My Design Journey
## Introduction
Hi! I'm Oroni. While I majored in computer science and most of my interships and courses are related to software development, I also specialized in human-computer interaction (HCI) and minored in psychology, so I have also been interested in the design process. I have always been a visual person with illustration as my lifetime hobby, so UI was what first interested me. I started playing around in Adobe XD and Figma back in second year and created some prototypes, familiarizing myself with the platforms and its tools. Later, in my last term of undergrad, I took an HCI course where we went through the entire UX design process to create a high-fidelity prototype of an app based on our own user resesarch. While my exposure to this field has been brief, I have enjoyed exploring how to create features and design choices that meet users' needs.

## Chef 449

CS 449 (HCI) allowed me to get hands-on experience with the UX process by working collaboratively within a team of four to create a high-fidelity prototype of an app with a personalized AI cooking assistant. Our goal was to create a smooth and user-friendly experience with this AI-assisted app through generating recipes based on ingredients and kitchenware the user already has, as well as the dietary needs and restrictions of the user. The app also aimed to customize recipe instructions based on the user's skill-level. While going through the design process, we also kept a thorough documentation which included our value proposition, personas, user interviews, affinity diagram, empathy maps, reflections, story boards, feature brainstorming, peer critiques and design evaluations, prototype iterations, and more. My teammates and I wrote up this project portfolio that summarizes keypoints from the whole process, check it out! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lNVjurTwWHKNS7iNYl6BO3pldFBV6Yz0v93p5wTdlug/edit?usp=sharing

Some of my favourite parts in the process were conducting user interviews, coming up with features based on findings on our users, reflecting on our design and improving it, and creating graphics to make the app more visually appealing. It was fun to exercise my creativity and problem-solving when coming up with features and reflecting on our design, although we did not have to fully implement all the features we thought of.

## Flower App

This was one of my first attempts at designing an app, which was meant to allow users to design their own flower bouquet and get it delivered. It was never finished and was before I researched design standards, but I thought it was a good start though it contains some weak pages:  https://xd.adobe.com/view/fc054bc6-14f2-482d-88d9-31be452a3e26-a956/
